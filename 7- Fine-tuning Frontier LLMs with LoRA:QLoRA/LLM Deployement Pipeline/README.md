## 5-Step Strategy: From Business Problem to Production LLM

> A repeatable playbook for applying LLMs to real-world tasks.

1. **Understand**  
   - **What?** Deeply capture the business requirements:  
     - Success criteria (model-centric vs business-centric metrics)  
     - Non-functional constraints (cost, latency, scalability)  
   - **Why?** Ensures you measure the right KPIs (training & validation loss, average price error, “good” estimates).

2. **Prepare**  
   - **Research**  
     - Baseline (non-LLM) solutions  
     - Candidate LLMs (context window, cost, license, benchmarks)  
   - **Curate your data**  
     - Clean, preprocess, dedupe  
     - Split into train / validation / test sets  

3. **Select**  
   - **Pick the model(s)** to experiment with (frontier vs open-source).  
   - **Train & validate** on your curated data.  
   - **Hold out** a final test split for unbiased evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Customize**  
   - **Prompting** (few-shot, chain-of-thought, function-calling) for quick, low-cost gains.  
   - **RAG** (retrieve + generate) to tap large knowledge bases with minimal fine-tuning.  
   - **Fine-tuning** for deep domain expertise, nuance, style transfer, and faster inference.

   > **Note:** prompting & RAG are _inference-time_ techniques, while fine-tuning is a _training-time_ investment.

5. **Productionize**  
   - **Deploy** into a robust pipeline (monitoring, versioning, latency SLAs).  
   - **Guard against “catastrophic forgetting”** by scheduling periodic re-training & data refresh.  
   - **Report** business metrics (e.g. % of estimates within \$X or Y%) on live traffic.

> **Why follow these steps?**  
> This structured journey—from understanding the problem to productionizing your LLM—keeps you aligned with business goals, prevents wasted effort, and makes it easy to compare techniques (prompting, RAG, fine-tuning) in the contexts where they shine.
