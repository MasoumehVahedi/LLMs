Chat: ChatGPT

2- Anthropic
Models: Claude
Chat: Claude

3- Google
Models: Gemini
Chat: Gemini Advance

3- Cohere
Models: Command R+
Chat: Command R+

4- Meta
Models: Llama
Chat: meta.ai

5- Perplexity
Models: Perplexity
Search: Perplexity

## Building AI Agent Framework

### Agentic AI: Smarter Problem-Solving

Agentic AI helps AI agents tackle problems efficiently. Here's how:

- **Break tasks into steps** → Different AI models handle different parts.
- **Use tools** → AI can access extra tools for better results.
- **Collaborate** → AI agents work together in an environment.
- **Plan ahead** → One AI organizes tasks for the others.
- **Think independently** → AI remembers and acts beyond simple replies.

## Comparing LLMs to select for a project

Compare the following features of an LLM.

1- Basics 1:

- **Open-source or closed**
- **Release date and knowledge cut-off**
- **Parameters**
- **Training tokens**
- **Context length**

2- Basics 2:

- **Inference cost** -> API charge, Subscription or Runtime compute
- **Training cost**
- **Build cost** -> How much work will it be for you to create this solution.
- **Time to Market** -> How long does it take to build the LLM
- **Rate limits** -> run into some limits on how frequently you can call them. This is typically the case for subscription plans.
- **Speed** -> How quickly can generate a whole response?
- **Latency** -> How quickly does it first start responding with each token?
- **License** -> Whether we are dealing with open source or closed source to be allowed to use it.
